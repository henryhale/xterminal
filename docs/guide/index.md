# Introduction

:wave: Hello Dev!

You're reading the official documentation for [XTerminal](https://github.com/henryhale/xterminal).

## What is XTerminal?

**XTerminal** is a simple and perfomant web-based component written in TypeScript that lets you create command-line interfaces for use in the browser.

It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple yet powerful model that helps you develop command-line interfaces in the browser.

**XTerminal** is dependency-free as it requires no dependency to work. Just ship it in and you are just close to setting up your own in-browser CLI.

::: tip What You Should Know
Basic understanding and familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a major preresquite as the documentation assumes you already know.
If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into the library as your first step - grasp the basics and then come back!

Now that you know something about **XTerminal**, here is a brief definition of what it does;

- In a nutshell, it provides you with a single class from which your can create several terminal instances and mount them onto your webpage.

## What XTerminal is not?

::: warning
- XTerminal is not an application that can be downloaded and used just like others on your computer.
- XTerminal is not a fully fledged terminal application that comprises of all fundamental utility functions. It can't be connected to your terminal nor ssh, it's entirely browser based.

## Main Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

- **Simplicity**: Provide a simple and intuitive API that allows developers to quickly create web-based CLIs without the need for extensive setup or dependencies.

- **Performance**: Prioritize performance optimizations to ensure a smooth and responsive CLI experience, even with large outputs or complex interactions.

- **Flexibility**: Enable developers to customize and extend the library to meet the specific requirements of their applications. Provide a solid foundation while allowing for easy integration and customization.

We appreciate your interest in this project, and we hope that it will empower you to create impressive web-based command-line interfaces for your applications.
